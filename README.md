# Collaboration Tasks
## How to Collaborate
1. Fork the Repository: Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a Branch: Make a new branch for the feature you want to implement. Choose a clear and descriptive name for your branch.
3. Create Your Folder: Inside the tasks/ directory, create a folder with your nickname. **Make sure it's all lower case and does not contain spaces, numbers, or symbols.**
4. Include Your File: Add your feature file to the folder you created. Don't forget to include your file in `index.js` and call your feature from there.
5. Commit and Push: Once you have completed your feature, commit your changes and push the branch to your forked repository.
6. Submit a Pull Request: Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch of this repository. Make sure to include a clear description of the feature you've implemented.

## Additional Notes
